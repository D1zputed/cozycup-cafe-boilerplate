            <h4>Espresso</h4>
            <p>Espresso is the foundation of most specialty coffee drinks.
                It's a concentrated shot of coffee brewed by forcing hot, pressurized water through finely-ground coffee
                beans inside a small metal basket called a portafilter.</p>
            <span class="price">P250.00</span>
        </li>
        <li>Latte</li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cappuccino</h4>
            <p>A freshly pulled shot of espresso layered with steamed whole milk and thick rich foam to offer a
                luxurious velvety texture and complex aroma.</p>
            <span class="price">P200.00</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Flat White</h4>
            <p>A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso with microfoam.
                It generally has a higher proportion of espresso to milk than a caffe latte, and a thinner layer of
                microfoam than a cappuccino.</p>
            <span class="price">P250.00</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cold Brew</h4>
            <p>Cold Brew coffee is usually made by steeping coffee in water for a number of hours at cold or ambient
                temperature.</p>
            <span class="price">P240.00</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Iced Coffee</h4>
            <p>Iced Coffee is a cold version of your favorite coffee, but it's not simply a coffee that has been left to
                cool.
                Like a regular coffee, it's usually a combination of hot espresso and milk. However, iced is added to.

                and rich chocolate flavor. </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Croissant</h4>
            <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, but mostly associated with
                France.
                Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a
                layered yeast-leavened dough.</p>
