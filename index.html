                <p>Espresso is the foundation of most specialty coffee drinks.
                    It's a concentrated shot of coffee brewed by forcing hot, pressurized water through finely-ground coffee beans inside a small metal basket called a portafilter.</p>

                    Like a regular coffee, it's usually a combination of hot espresso and milk. However, iced is added to.</p>
